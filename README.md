## Explainable AI for credit risk assessment
In this project we aim to automate the process of credit risk assessment for an individual. Credit risk is assessed on a Home equity Line of Credit (HELOC) dataset. The task at hand is to utilise the information about a loan applicant's credit history to predict whether the lending institution should approve the loan or reject it. We use a classifier model to make a prediction of whether the applicant qualifies for a line of credit. After making the prediction, explainability methods such as LIME and PDP are used to explain which features in the dataset led to this decision. In addition to this, a visualization platform has been developed in the form of a web app for both applicants and lenders, to upload their own data and see if they qualify for a loan.

## Data

The dataset comprises of credit data from over 1 million individuals in the United States, provided by Fair Isaac Corporation -[FICO](https://community.fico.com/s/explainable-machine-learning-challenge). The dataset contains real world anonymized data related to home equity lines. It includes detailed credit-related attributes such as delinquency status, balance, credit utilization, and credit history, as well as demographic information.
